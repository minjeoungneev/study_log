## ðŸŒ² Random Forest
Random Forest is a type of supervised learning and an ensemble method that builds many decision trees. It aggregates predictions of each tree to make a final decision. In **random forest classifier**, each tree votes for a class label, and the final decision is made by the majority vote. In **random forest regressor**, the prediction is made with the averaged value across all trees.

Individual decision trees are weak learners, and random forest makes them stronger by combining their predictions. Therefore, the variance is reduced and the results are generalized better with random forest.
